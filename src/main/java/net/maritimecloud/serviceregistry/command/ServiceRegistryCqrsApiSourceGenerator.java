/**
 * Run the Main method of this class in order to re-build Command and Events specified in CqrsContracts. This generator will generate source
 * files into the "Generated Sources" folder.
 * <p>
 * The Generator cannot be build without a valid, compilable source base. This bootstrap-problem forms a classic "Hen and the Egg"-problem,
 * since the generated sources are needed to obtain a valid source base.
 * <p>
 * Until the bootstrap-problem is solved, you will need to put the generated classes under version-control, eg. by copying them up into the
 * source-folder, and delete the rest. Otherwise it will be impossible to rebuild from scratch.
 * <p>
 * To solve the problem the generator should use a parser that can run independently of whether the entire code base is in a valid state or
 * not, e.g an ANTLR-based parser.
