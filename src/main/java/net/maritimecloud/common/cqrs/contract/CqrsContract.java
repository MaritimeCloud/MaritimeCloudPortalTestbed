/**
 * This interface describes the interface to the ServiceRegitry in terms of Commands and Events. Whereas the commands are explicitly being
 * the published interface, the description of the events are more like a convenience as they in most cases share the properties of the
 * commands.
 * <p>
 * Events may inherit their properties from corresponding commands, and may extend those properties, as would be needed to make room for
 * enrichment.
 * <p>
 * The generator will take each method defined in the interface and create a corresponding class of the same name (capitalized first
 * letter). The class will be supplied with a constructor with the same signature and properties and getters and setters will be defined for
 * each of the arguments using the names of the arguments. The first argument MUST be the aggregate identity, and the names of the arguments
 * will be used for serialization when serializing to JSON.
