== Introduction
This guide will attempt to introduce some of the central elements of the 
Maritime Cloud Portal solution with a main focus on the server side 
architecture.

== Server architecture

=== History
It would be disingenuous to claim that the maritime cloud portal is equipped 
with a clean cut architecture. To understand why, and to assist in future 
decisions on what to change and what to keep, lets start out with a quick trip 
back in the short, yet bumpy road of the portal architecture history. 

In the start there was this idea of one web-application with one server side.
Then came the realization, that maybe this was more of one portal, interfacing 
with two possibly separate services, an "identity registry" and some "service 
registry".

The architecture started out as a layered architecture, with an interface, 
an application, a domain and a persistence layer, just as most traditional 
server applications use to have. However, it had a slight bias towards "ports 
and adapters architecture", focusing more on isolating the domain from the 
other layers than on enforcing the traditional roles of the other layers. Also, 
this was all seasoned with tactical patterns from the domain driven design 
literature, like Entities, Value Objects, Services and Repositories. A little 
later on, the ideas of command and query responsibility segregation were 
introduced, at first as a handmade solution, and quickly thereafter fully 
embracing the existing framework called "Axon". The reason for choosing CQRS 
was that it should be well suited for collaboration solutions with many reads 
and limited write operations. Also, it was the expectation that this 
architecture would yield a more flexible domain model that would be easier to 
modify and extend. The concept of aggregates has also become more explicitly 
visible after the introduction of CQRS not the least due to the annotations 
introduced by the Axon framework. 

=== Modules
Currently there are four high level modules (java packages) in the solution. In 
the future, this might be split out into two to three separate applications 
depending how this fit into the broader architectural picture. One direction to
follow could be to split the solution into two separate micro-services, one for 
each of the bounded contexts of identity management and service registry, if, 
however, one agree that this is in fact a suitable breakdown of the problem 
domain. The current module structure could be seen as an early attempt to move 
into this direction, however, there are still some remaining dependencies that 
reveal that this initiative is far from completed. A first next step in this 
direction would be to introduce multiple separate POM modules, hereby 
indicating more cleanly the separation of the sub-domains. 

Common::
Tools, utilities and tactical framework-like components that are generic enough 
to be placed in a separate module.

Identity Registry::
Module concerned with the identification and authentication of (mainly) users. 
It could be argued that the identity of organizations should also be handled 
from here, however this is not currently the case, mainly out of convenience.

Service Registry::
The Service Registry is concerned with, obviously, services; how they are 
defined, where they are offered and by whom. As a side effect, Organizations 
are also defined here, as is organization memberships. 

Portal::
The portal module itself is mainly gathering everything else needed to deliver 
the services to the web-based client. This is where a login context (security) 
is setup and where (some of) the services are exposed as RESTful resources. 

=== Domain

The implemented part of the Maritime Cloud Portal domain consists of the four 
central concepts: the users, the organizations, the service specifications and 
the services. In addition we have (organization) memberships and aliases.

==== User, Organizations and Memberships

image::user-member-org.png[]
The User may sign up to the system and create organizations. Organizations may 
invite users, and users may request membership of organizations. They both may
choose to revoke a membership, and both must give their concent when the other 
part initiates a membership. 

==== Organizations and Services

image::org-service.png[]
Organizations may create Service Specifications and Service Instances.

==== Services

image::service.png[]
A Service Instance is an actual service offered by an organization and that 
adheres to a certain Service Specification. The Service Specification details 
what a service does and how to interact with this kind of service. The service 
specification may also (somehow) be categorized according to its operational 
qualities (see next section).

NOTE: There is another concept in the domain of the the Maritime Cloud, called 
the "_Operational Service_". This is sort of a Categorization of services. 
However, in the solution this has only been implemented as a static list, and 
the mapping of Service Specifications to operational services is done scanning 
the summary part of the specification for the occurrence of an operational 
service ID, also, this mapping is only applied in the REST resource. 
There has been quite a lot of confusion about the meaning of this concept. 
From a domain expert perspective, there is a strong feeling that this is a real 
concept and should be modeled as such. However, they seem to regard it as a 
one-to-many relationship. From a developer perspective this looks more like the 
concept of a "Category" placing services within one or more categories of 
"Operations", hence, a many-to-many relationship. The topic needs more analysis 
to be fully understood.

=== CQRS and Event Sourcing
The following sections will outline the CQRS solution and eventually introduce 
the Contract generator tool.

==== Concept
The basic concepts of Command and Query Responsibility Segregation is to split
the traditional single, "encompass-all" domain model into two separate 
models, one for writing and one for reading. The writing model will focus on
protecting transactional consistency, whereas the reading model will focus on
fast delivery of information. The key to achieve this split is to accept a 
certain level of eventual consistency. Combine this with event sourcing and
you will in return get a system that may both be scalable and open for 
extension. 

===== Axon Framework
The Axon Framework is a framework that provides a lot of the generic building 
blocks that you are likely to need when implementing an event sourced domain 
model. You can read more about Axon Framework at [http://www.axonframework.org/]

==== The flow of commands and events
This section will roughly outline the flow of commands and events from a 
Command hits the RESTful resource and until a response for a view request hits 
the client. Notice, however, that this includes two requests from the client: 
one for the command, and one (or more) for the later querying of the result of 
applying the command. 

image::mcp-command-flow.png[]

====== (1) RESTful facade
When a web client submits a command to the Maritime Cloud Portal it is done in 
terms of a HTTP POST or UPDATE request containing a JSON formatted command. The
command will be submitted against the resource that it addresses (using the 
path) and the type of command will be stated as part of the mime-type. 

The 
"Resource"-classes lives in the packages 
`net.maritimecloud.identityregistry.resource` and 
`net.maritimecloud.portal.resource`.

Once the command hits the targeted resource class, it is unwrapped and parsed 
to a corresponding java-based Command class. Some validation and processing
may happen in between (although more is needed before prime time) checking that 
the user is allowed to perform the action and for instance resolving any 
alias-references and adding resource references from the path to the command.

====== (2) CommandGateway
After the command has been instantiated it is sent to the _CommandGateway_. This
is an Axon framework and constitutes the entrance to the CQRS engine. From here 
on the flow is more or less controlled by Axon. The command may be delivered to 
the gateway in two ways: blocking or non-blocking. In the first way, the method
only returns once the command has been handled, in the second way, the method
returns as soon as any command validators has succeeded. Currently, the first
way is used by Maritime Cloud Portal, but this was merely done out of 
coincidence, as this was how the initial trails started out. It is expected that 
the non-blocking way can be used as well, maybe even yielding smoother user 
experience.

Through Axon, it is possible to apply various validators on the incoming 
commands which will be evaluated before a command is dispatched to the Command
Handler. This is not currently used in MCP, but might come in handy in the 
future. Especially the possibility to verify arguments according to annotated
Bean Validation (see the JSR303 specification) could be useful in order to 
protect against misbehaving clients.

====== (3) CommandHandler
The CommandGateway dispatches the command (through a bus) to the registered 
handler. There can be only one handler per Command, and Axon will complain if 
more are registered or if none is found.

The CommandHandler is a method that is annotated with the Axon annotation 
`@CommandHandler`. The annotation may be used on a method in the target 
aggregate, hereby skipping the step where the handler look up the target 
aggregate and invoke a method on it. Both strategies are used in the maritime 
cloud portal, and you may expect to find CommandHandler methods in both classes 
named e.g. `UserCommandHandler` as well as directly in the aggregate `User`.

===== (4) Aggregate: Command Validation
The target aggregate is where the domain logic lives. In the context of the
command it will be guarding invariants dictated by business rules. Usually this
implies that the aggregate will perform some validation logic that ensures that 
the command does not violate any of its business rule in its current state. 

===== (5) Aggregate: Event Sourcing Handler
If all tests has passed, the aggregate method will create one or more events 
and apply them to the aggregate. This will add the them to a queue of 
uncommitted events and invoke the any relevant `EventSourcingHandlers`, methods
that handles events of a specific kind, implemented by the aggregate. This is 
where the state of the aggregate is actually changed, and it is the exact same 
methods that are invoked during replay of an aggregates events, when rebuilding 
an aggregate from its event stream.

===== (6) AggregateRepository
When the Unit of Work (managed by axon) completes, the events are stored in the 
`AggregateRepository` and emitted on an event bus that will notify any registered 
listeners asynchronously.

===== Replayable File System Event Store
The current solution is using the Axon file based event store (see Axon 
`FileSystemEventStore`). This is a store that creates a folder per Aggregate 
Root, currently under the "target/events"-folder, and keeps a file in this 
folder, for each instance. The naming of the files matches the aggregates names 
and IDs, e.g. 
`target/events/Organization/OrganizationId+%5Bid%3D759d4a81%5D.events`.

The original Axon file store do not support replaying of events out of the box. 
To mitigate this problem, an extension has been made, that implements the 
missing replay methods, `ReplayableFileSystemEventStore`. Since the file store 
do not keep track of the overall sequence of events, it is necessary to apply 
some sort of best effort strategy to estimate the sequence based on timestamps 
and in rare cases sequences numbers or other. This implies that all aggregates 
and events are scanned and indexed, and then replayed according to this 
ordering. 

WARNING: This is not production quality!!! But serves well when needing a 
compromise between look-alike-persistence, flexibility and complexity.

You can manually delete aggregate files. Some or all. Move them in and out, and 
even store them in your source repository if you like. It is possible to inspect 
the files in a plain text editor, although some characters may look weird.


==== The View models
In order to keep the views models up to date they register on the EventBus to 
listen for relevant events. In the Maritime Cloud Portal the listeners follow a 
naming scheme of `<viewname>Listener`, like e.g. `OrganizationListener`. 

The View-listeners maintains projections of the event stream by using 
simpleminded JPA entities and extensions of generic JPA repositories.

The entities are named `<viewname>Entry`, like e.g. OrganizationEntry and the 
repositories are named `<viewname>QueryRepository`, like e.g. 
`OrganizationQueryRepository.

The views and supporting classes are kept in packages named `*.query`.

===== Replay of events 
In the current solution all the view models are kept in an "In Memory" 
relational database. This implies that all models are lost at shut-down. In
order to rebuild the model at startup, all events in the aggregate event store
are replayed. In a production environment this should be changed to use a 
persistent database, and the `replay-at-startup-feature` should be disabled.

==== Sagas
Some use cases cannot be completed by a single command, and may need to span
several events. One scenario is the activation of a new user. This cannot 
happen until the user has signed up and verified the email address. Axon 
provides an implementation for the generic concept called a Saga, a.k.a. "a 
long running process". In Maritime Cloud Portal it also comes in handy when
handling e-mail communication and could also be used for compensating handling
of rare, but complex business rule violations. 

The sagas in Maritime Cloud Portal lives side by side with their 
related aggregates in the command package. See for instance
`net.maritimecloud.identityregistry.command.user.ConfirmEmailAddressSaga`.

[#cqrs-contract]
==== The Contract tool
Defining Command and Event classes can be a repetitive task, and the resulting 
structures has so many similarities that the process simply begs for 
automation. For that reason, and for the convenience of having a single and 
concise description of the interface to the command model, a simpleminded 
tool has been designed that can scan a java interface file, called a 
"Contract" and generate Command and Event classes based on the annotated 
methods that it contains. 

The common generator utility and the corresponding annotations "Command" and 
"Event" can be found in the package "net.maritimecloud.common.cqrs.contract".

Two examples of this contract and generator can be found in the Maritime Cloud 
Portal: `net.maritimecloud.identityregistry.command.IdentityRegistryContract` 
and `net.maritimecloud.serviceregistry.command.ServiceRegistryContract`. These 
contracts also marks an excellent starting point for investigating what 
behavior is offered by the domain. Example of the contract: 

[source,java]
----
include::../java/net/maritimecloud/identityregistry/command/IdentityRegistryContract.java[]
----

When running the "Generator", like e.g. the `IdentityRegistryCqrsApiSourceGenerator` 
it scans the contract and build the corresponding Command and Event classes. 
The resulting classes are placed in a predefined package, usually called "api". 
This package is placed in the source structure which is under version control. 
The reason for that is a bit of a "Hen and the Egg" problem which is solved 
using a poor mans tactic. The problem is that the generator itself cannot be 
build and run if the source has compile errors. Errors, that will obviously be 
there when initially building the project, because the Commands and Events that 
are likely to be referenced elsewhere in the source has not yet been build. 
Placing the generated classes under version control ensures that they are 
present at compile time, allowing the generator to be build and run. But then, 
what is the gain, if the classes are already there, you ask? The gain is, that 
when you want to introduce a new command or event, you can specify it as a 
method in the contract, and then simply run the generator and be assured that 
the resulting Command or Event class is implemented according to the same 
pattern as all the rest. Another benefit is that you have a single file that 
lists all the commands that your model understands, and all the events that it 
emits. Also, the generated classes all has a javadoc "@see" tag that points 
back to the source contract, allowing for navigation if your IDE supports it.

===== Testing
Notice, that, at least on Netbeans, you can actually also use the Command or 
Event in a unit test in advance of it being defined, as this folder needs not 
be compilable for the generator to build and run. Why is that important, you 
ask? 
Well, because this aligns very well with the modus operandi of writing behavior 
driven tests in advance of your implementation, which you love to do, right? 

===== Refactoring
The drawback is of course the awkward situation when refactoring an existing 
Command or Event. In this case it is recommended to use the IDE's refactoring 
tool to change the Command or Event, and then after the fact, commence the same
changes to the contract.

==== Extending the domain
Extending the behavior of the system is achieved in a series of steps, starting
with deciding the intention of the new feature. From this, a name for the 
corresponding command should be chosen. Given the new command, it may already 
be evident which events will be emitted from such a command, thus, these may
also be ready to be defined in the Contract file. Arguments for the command
and events should be decided. Command arguments usually consist of parameters 
that points out the target aggregate as well as the payload of the command, 
the new value to apply or whatever is needed to perform the intended action.
Likewise, Events will have at least a mandatory identity reference, and
usually will repeat the values from the command. In addition, events may 
contain redundant "convenience values", values that may make the life simpler 
for the consumers of the events, for instance it may provide the name of 
a user, instead of just the user id, hence making a separate lookup  by the 
consumer unnecessary.

When the Contract is in place, it is time to generate the corresponding classes.
From there, the command should be introduced in a "Command Handler", either in
a dedicated "CommandHandler" or embedded directly in the targeted aggregate. 

One thing to keep in mind when implementing the handling method is, that in 
contrast to a traditional Service method, the Command Handler method should 
merely call the targeted aggregate and have it verify, that the intended action 
can in fact take place, that is, validate that the state and state-change is 
valid. It should NOT change any state in this scope. When all seems to be clear, 
the aggregate command method should create and emit the corresponding event, 
signaling that this action has now taken place. Next, the corresponding event 
listener is added to the Aggregate. It's only during handling of the event, that 
changes to the state is applied to the aggregate. This can be a mind-twister at 
first, but try to keep in mind that the "true" state of the aggregate is 
expressed by its sequence of events, and only when replaying the sequence from 
the start to the end will you get to the current state. Hence, all state 
changes must be initiated by events and events only. If you use the Axon 
framework to write unit tests, it will assist you in getting some of these
things right. 

Now, presuming you got to a stage where you have introduced a command; has 
defined a handler; has registered this command handler to the Command Gateway;
has introduced at least one new event; and, if that event causes state changes,
has introduced a listener for that event on the aggregate. Then you still have 
some way to go. First, you probably want to be able to submit that command. And
later on, you probably also wants to be able to see the effect of the command.

In the Maritime Cloud Portal, the first part is handled in the RESTful resources. 
You must decide how and where the new command fit in, and after identifying the 
correct resource, you should add a POST or PUT handler to the suitable path.

Finally, viewing the result of the command may be achieved either from an 
existing view, or it may be necessary to introduce a new view. The view consists
of an Event Listener, an "Entry" kind of a JPA entity that mainly consist of 
the aggregate id and the exact values that fulfill the need of at least one 
client use case, and a corresponding (generic) query repository. The listener 
will, depending on the event, create a new entry or find and update an existing 
entry. Finally, the SpringData-based generic JPA repository interface will 
expose a new tailored query, or maybe the existing generic query will do.

=== Security
Access to the web interface of Maritime Cloud Portal is guarded by the Apache 
Shiro security framework [http://shiro.apache.org/]. The configuration file can 
be found at `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/shiro.ini`.

Shiro is configured to support basic username-password authentication with a 
role-based authorization scheme. Users can be either _anonymous_, _user_ or 
_admin_. In the current implementation, only the user with the username "admin"
has the role "admin".

Passwords are hashed before they are stored in Shiros cache, and as well as in 
the application.

The integration with the Shiro framework mainly happens in three classes:

- MaritimeCloudIdentityRealm
- McpAuthorizationFilter
- ShiroAuthenticationUtil 

MaritimeCloudIdentityRealm:: 
This is an implementation of the abstract Shiro class `AuthorizingRealm`. It 
provides Shiro with application specific user identity and user role 
information. 

McpAuthorizationFilter:: A filter that mainly adds proper handling of "access 
denied". More specifically it sets the http error response to the status code 
401, indicating that the request requires HTTP authentication throws. 

ShiroAuthenticationUtil:: Utility to programmatically login and logout the 
user, to get the current users id and to tell if the current user is logged in. 

Example of shiro.ini: 

[source,shell]
----
include::../webapp/WEB-INF/shiro.ini[]
----

=== Spring boot and the micro service
The application has been assembled as a Spring Boot standalone executable WAR.
Please refer to the project POM and the Spring Boot documentation 
[http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/] for details about how to configure and 
tweak this part.

Please refer to the GITHUB project page for instructions on launching the 
application [https://github.com/MaritimeCloud/MaritimeCloudPortalTestbed].

Notice that spring allows a plethora of ways to manipulate application 
properties, mainly through overriding versions of the 
`application.properties`-file.

== Client architecture
The client is a Single Page Application client based on AngularJS with twitter 
bootstrap like styling and using Leaflet API for Geodata representations. 

Server side communication is based on the REST with JSON by using the angular 
Resource service.

==== Imported libraries
External libraries lives in the `/ext`-folder. Most are managed by Bower in 
´/ext/bower´ and are ingored by GIT, but a few are manually imported and are 
added to source-control.

=== Modules and central files 
All client application files lives in the `src/main/webapp/app`-folder. 

==== App.js and ui-routing
The app.js contains the entry setup of angular and defines the internal 
routing structure in terms of the Angular-UI routing mechanism. The 
structure is split into two major zones, an anonymous and authorized zone 
called "public" and "restricted" respectively. Attempts to access a 
restricted zone will trigger an authorization check, and if it fails, the 
login dialog is displayed.

==== Layout and partials
This module contains elements that defines the general structure of the UI, 
like footer, header, sidebar, menubar and layout of public and restricted 
area. Also some general purpose elements like panels and the like are defined 
here.

The dashboard and the landingpage are kept in the module "partials", mainly 
for historical reasons.

==== Services
This is a mainly various angular "Services".

===== Dataservices
"dataservices.js" contains "Services" for communicating with the server. All
commands used by the client are defined here, as well as a service per 
resource.

==== Aggregates
All the major concepts, like users, organizations and search services, has 
their own modules.  

=== More information
Please refer to the GITHUB project page for further information about the 
client architecture - mainly the technology stack:
