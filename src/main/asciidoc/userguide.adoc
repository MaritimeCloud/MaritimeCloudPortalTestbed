== Introduction

=== The vision and the domain
In its own words, the Maritime Cloud project as a whole aims at providing: 
[quote]
A communication framework enabling efficient, secure, reliable and seamless 
electronic information exchange between all authorized maritime stakeholders 
across available communication systems.

In that context, the Maritime Cloud Portal aims to facilitate management of 
some of the more static parts of the system. More specifically, to provide 
an API and a client for managing an Identity Registry and a Service Registry.

The Identity Registry contains information about users and organizations, and
associate them with an identity within the Maritime Cloud realm. Also, this 
registry will (eventually) be able to provide the means for secure 
authentication and communication presumably by some sort of cryptographic
scheme.

The Service Registry contains information about which services is provided
within a certain region as well as specifications on how to communicate with 
families of services.

=== The given and the gap
The current version of the Maritime Cloud Portal (v0.1.0) only implements
a very limited set of the features envisioned for the final product and provides 
sketches of a few more. In its current version, the client allows users to:

* creation of organizations
* provision of spatially defined services
** management of endpoints
* location based search for services
* organization and service alias support
* management of user membership
* activity log

Below is a list of features that should or could be part of future versions:

* creation and management of Service Specifications and a module for collaboration 
* creation and management of Operational Service categories
* management of identity certificates
* management of user assets and assigning identity to such
* delegation of trust

== Web client user interface

image::landingpage.png[]

The following sections outlines how to interact with the portal web client. A 
version of the portal is currently running at http://portal.maritimecloud.net.

=== Access
This section explains how to gain access to the portal and how to login, logout
and to how to reset to a new password.

==== Sign up
In order to get access to the portal, you need to register with a unique 
username and an e-mail address. Click on the "Join" button and fill in the 
registration page.

image::join-button.png[scaledwidth="10%"]
image::join-form.png[]

Once you are done you will receive an e-mail with an activation link. Following 
the link will confirm your e-mail address and activate your registration.

==== Login
From the landing page, click on the "Log In" button and fill in your username 
and password. Notice that the username must be spelled exactly as created - the 
casing of the letters matters.

image::login-form.png[role="thumb", scaledwidth="40%"]

==== Forgot Password
If you can no longer remember your password, or if you forgot your username you
may still have a change to gain access to the portal. Click the "Forgot password"
link in the "Log In" form, and supply your e-mail address.

image::forgot-password.png[role="thumb", scaledwidth="40%"]

If your e-mail address matches an account you will shortly receive an email with 
a link. Follow the link in order to provide a new password. 

image::forgot-password-change.png[]

Once done, login with your new password.

==== Logout
Simple! Just click the "Log out" button in the upper right corner.

=== Dashboard
On the dashboard you find a mix of general system information and 
information related to the current user.

image::dashboard-haddock.png[]

Statistics::
Just beneath the title is a line of statistics that list the total number of
organizations, services, specifications, categories and users currently in the
system.

Organizations::
Then follows a list of the organizations that the user is a member of or is in
the process of becoming a member of. A yellow label to the right of an 
organization will indicate that the user has applied for membership of this 
organization. Likewise, if you have been invited to an organization, a green 
button will be shown asking for your approval to join the organization.
A grey badge with a number indicates that someone has applied for membership of 
an organization of which you are an owner. (Note: in the current version, all 
members are also owners!).

The following sections: "Assets", "Achievements" and "Public certificates" are 
mock ups, that is, static examples of how things could look in the future: 

Assets (mocked)::
Assets should be listing things that are possessed by the user 
and that has some kind of relevancy in the maritime community. Usually this 
would be things that for one reason or another needs to be associable with the 
identity of the user and has an identity of its own. Examples could be vessels 
and electronic communication devices. Registered assets has a configurable list
of named properties. Each property may refer to some characteristic of the 
asset, for instance an IMO number, AIS number, a network identification number
or a radio call-name. Through some yet undefined process, an organizations may 
then decide to issue a certificate that authenticate all or a subset of the
properties of an asset and hereby granting privileges to the holder of the 
certificate.

Achievements (mocked)::
Achievements should somehow list the various privileges received by 
organizations.

Public Certificates (mocked)::
A section called "Public Certificates" should list public keys that this user
has uploaded to the system. The user should hold on to the corresponding 
private key. 

Activity Feeds::
This section consists of three sub sections, one for feeds of actions performed
by yourself, a list of actions happening in any of the organizations that you 
are a member of, and one for other publicly available actions. The same feed may
possibly occur in all three lists.

=== Menu
The menu bar consists of up to four visible elements; the brand, a context selector 
which is only visible when applicable, a user menu and access buttons.

Below follows the four most common states of the menu:

image::menu-anon.png[title="Not logged in"]

image::menu-bering.png[title="A new user, called Bering, without any organization memberships"]

image::menu-haddock.png[title="A user with organization memberships, working in context of the user"]

image::menu-haddock-org.png[title="A user with organization memberships, working in context of an organization"]

image::menu-brand.png[role="thumb right"]
Brand:: The brand link in the left side of the menu bar may be used to navigate 
back to the landingpage.

image::menu-context-haddock.png[role="thumb right"]
Context selector:: The context selector is only visible when the user is a member of at least one 
organization. It allows the user to switch between the administered 
organizations and the user. Currently, the main effect of switching context is
that the selector shows the currently selected context, and, if the selected 
context is an organization, then a special organization menu item will appear
in the sidebar. This menu allows for creation of new services.

In future versions the content of the dashboard might also depend on the 
currently selected context.

image::menu-user-bering-new.png[role="thumb right"]
User menu::
The user menu allows to manage the user profile. Also, when the user is no yet
a member of any organizations, a new organization may be created from this 
menu.

image::menu-access.png[role="right", scaledwidth="10%"]
Access buttons::
Access buttons may be used to join, log in and out.

=== Sidebar

The sidebar contains actions that are possible from the currently selected 
context. 

Dashboard:: Link that brings you back to the dashboard.

Search Service:: Opens up a list of search criteria and navigate to the 
search service page map. See "Search Service" TODO add link here.

Find Organization:: Opens up a page that list all organizations in the system. 

Organization:: context related menu section that is only visible when an 
organization has been selected in the context selector. Allows to add services 
to the currently selected organization.

Administration:: Menu section only visible to admin users. Allows to navigate 
to a page listing all users in the system. 

=== Organization
This section describes the organization details page, how to create a new 
Organization and how to modify its properties.

==== The Organizations page
On the organization page you find a summary description and lists of members, 
teams, services and specifications.

image::organization-haddock-flh.png[]
On the organization page you can find a list of who is member of the 
organization, what services is provisioned by it as well of which service 
specifications, if any, that has been published by the organization. If you
have writing privileges to the organization, then a little "gear" will 
appear after the title of elements that may be changed.

Header:: 
The title, a summary description of the organization and possibly a site URL 
that points to the organizations official website.

Members box::
The members box previews the list of members of the organization. If the 
logged in user is also owner of the displayed organization, two additional 
lists may appear: one for listing users that has applied for membership, and
one for listing users that has been invited to the organization but has not yet
accepted membership. Membership applications may be quickly accepted by 
clicking the green "Accept"-button.  

Teams box (mocked)::
The teams box is intended for providing means for sub-grouping members into 
teams that can for instance receive with special privileges within the 
organization. This could for instance offer a way to distinguish owners from 
plain members, or create teams with limited write-access.

image::provided-services-summary.png[align="center"]
image::provided-service-thumb.png[role="thumb right related"]
Provided Services::
This section consists of a summary thumbnail map and a list of all the 
services that are provisioned by the organization. The first (and largest) 
thumbnail map is a summary map that outlines all the areas covered by the 
services provisioned by this organization. Below the summary thumbnail follows
a list of the services. Each service is represented by a title, a (smaller) 
thumbnail map and a summary description of the service. Clicking on the 
map will make the details-section unfold.   

image::service-specifications.png[role="thumb right related"]
Service Specifications (read only)::
This section lists all the service specifications that has been published by 
the organization or is still under construction. The client implementation does
not currently provide a way to create new specifications. (Refer to the REST API
documentation for details on how to publish new specifications.) 

image::organization-certificates.png[role="thumb right related"]
Public Certificates (mocked)::
This section is intended for listing all the public certificates that has been
uploaded to the organization and may be used for validating signed messages or 
encrypt communication with. [The details and inner mechanics of such 
functionality is still undecided!].

==== Creating a new organization
Creating a new organization is done in two different ways depending on your 
current status:
- If you have no existing or pending memberships you open up the toolbar user 
menu and click on "Create organization" item.
- If you already a member you should open up the toolbar context selection menu 
and click on the "Manage organizations" item. This will take you to page that 
lists all your organization memberships. In the top right corner of the list is 
a button called "+ New organization".

image::organization-form.png[role="thumb"]
Fill in the organization form. The identifier is also known as the primary alias 
and must be unique amongst all organizations. The alias will impact on the way
the organization is represented in e.g. URLs and may impact on the resource 
addresses in maritime cloud as well, although this part is not yet finally 
decided. The alias could be something shorthand like "imo" or "dma" and should
possibly match or be similar to the organizations domain name representation.

::Logo (mocked)
/The Logo upload feature is not implemented!/

==== Changing an organization
In order to change setting of an organization click on the "Gears" icon right to 
the organization title on the organization details page. 

==== Leaving an organization
Leaving an organization can be managed from the organizations page. Open up the 
toolbar context selection menu and click on the "Manage organizations" item.

=== Services
Organizations may register provisioned services. A service, sometimes also
referred to as a "technical service", is something that an organization 
provides and that adheres to a specific Service Specification. A service can
be as simple as a call-name and a VHF channel, a phone number or the address of 
a web site, but can also be something more profound like a web based weather 
forecasting service following a certain standardized interface given by its 
service specification and reachable on several medias and schemes like HTTP or 
AIS.

==== Register a Service
To register a new service navigate to the organization page and click on the 
blue button of that name.

image::register-service-1.png[role="thumb"]
image::register-service-2.png[role="thumb"]

Operational Service (Category)::
To fill in the form, start by choosing the category of service you are about to 
register, also known as the "Operational Service". 

service specification::
Then select the service specification that the service follows. If your service 
can be reached on multiple platforms or schemes you will need to register the 
service multiple times, once for each type, e.g. VHF, Phone, WWW, HTTP, AIS 
etc...

Name::
Choose a name for the service, this will be used when presenting the service.

Primary alias::
As with organizations, the services may have one or more aliases. The first one, 
the primary one, cannot be changed one chosen, and must be unique within the 
organization. The alias may (in the future) be used as part of the URI when 
referring to the service in the Maritime Cloud Server.

Summary:: 
Add a short description that will accompany the service when presented in 
search results.

Endpoints::
A service need to be reachable somehow. The endpoints defines how to reach the 
service. Depending on the type of service, the endpoint scheme may be e.g. a 
phone number, a VHF number, a HTTPS address or something else. You may specify 
multiple service endpoints for the sake of redundancy. It must, however be the 
same service that is provided by all endpoints, and should only be used for
fallback or high availability reasons. 

image::coverage-editor.png[role="thumb right"]
Coverage::
The physical range of the service is referred to as the service "Coverage".
Services usually apply to a restricted physical area. Either because of the 
limitations of the service, like radio reachability or more likely because of
the character of the service. Piloting may for instance be restricted to 
domestic waters, and portal services only make sense close to the port and so 
on. Click on the map to enter the coverage editor. This will open a new window
where shapes may be drawn, specifying the range of the service. Click on type
of shape that suits your needs and then click on the map to use it. Once done,
click on the submit-button, or click cancel if you regret.

When all is set, click on the "register service" button. 

==== Change service settings
To change an already registered service click on the "gear" icon right to the 
service title on the organization page.

Secondary aliases::
It is common for organizations to be known both by their domestic name and 
their international name. For that reason it is also possible to choose 
multiple aliases for organizations and their provisioned services. On the 
"change service" page you may choose to supply or change additional aliases.

=== Find Services
All the registering of provisioned services has little or no purpose if they
cannot be found. The side-bar menu "Find Service" mitigates that problem. When
clicking this menu, a map will appear that is "zoomed out" to a level that 
covers all currently registered services in the system. 

image::search-service.png[]
By clicking on a position on the map it will zoom in on the services that 
covers that particular spot and a list of the selected services 
will appear.footnote:[More precisely, each service that has the position 
in its "bounding box", will be shown. This also implies, that sometimes 
services that may only appear to be near by, but not actually covering the 
selected position, will also show up on the list.]

A set of filters in the sidebar allows to further narrow the result list to 
services of for instance a specific kind or name.

Hovering any of the items on the list will make that service highlighted (in 
green) on the map and vice versa. 

Clicking an item on the list will highlight (in blue) and zoom in on that 
service and expand a details section below the list showing the service 
summary, the provisioning organization, endpoints and so on.

An info-box in the lower right corner tells the current position of the mouse 
cursor as well as the distance from the mouse cursor to the selected location.

=== Managing memberships

==== Organization members
Apart from signing up with the system and create own organizations, users may 
also apply for membership of existing organizations as well as invite existing
users to own organizations or expel members that no longer should belong. Most
of these actions can be initiated from the "Members" page. This is a list of 
all the current members of the organization as well as any pending memberships.

image::members.png[align="center"]
This page can be reached from the Organizations page by clicking on the title 
of the "Members" box which is also a link.

image::invite-member.png[role="right related"]
Invite member::
New members can be invited to an organization by navigating to the Members 
page and clicking the "+ Invite someone" button in the top right corner. Users
that has been invited but has not yet accepted the invitation will appear on 
the list with an "Invited" label sticked to it.

Remove member::
Existing members as well as pending members may be removed from the 
organization by clicking the "Remove" link.

Accept membership application::
When a user has applied for membership of your organization a link "Accept 
application" will appear on that users line. Clicking the link will accept the 
users application and make that user a full member of the organization.

===== Membership
As a user you can manage your membership by applying an organization for it, 
you can receive an invite that you can accept and you can leave an 
organization, as long as you're not the last to leave.

image::membership-join.png[role="right related"]
Apply for membership::
As a user you may apply for membership by navigating to the organizations page 
and click on the "Join" button in the Member box.

Accept an invite::
Likewise, if you already received an invitation to join an organization, a 
button called "Accept invite" is displayed in the Member box and on the 
dashboard.

Leave organization::
In order to leave an organization you can click the "Leave" button in the 
Member box.
