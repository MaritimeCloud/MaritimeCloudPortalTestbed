== Introduction

=== The vision and the domain
In its own words, the Maritime Cloud project as a whole aims at providing: 
[quote]
A communication framework enabling efficient, secure, reliable and seamless 
electronic information exchange between all authorized maritime stakeholders 
across available communication systems.

In that context, the Maritime Cloud Portal aims to facilitate management of 
some of the more static parts of the system. More specifically, to provide 
an API and a client for managing an Identity Registry and a Service Registry.

The Identity Registry contains information about users and organizations, and
associate them with an identity within the Maritime Cloud realm. Also, this 
registry will (eventually) be able to provide the means for secure 
authentication and communication presumably by some sort of cryptographic
scheme.

The Service Registry contains information about which services is provided
within a certain region as well as specifications on how to communicate with 
families of services.

=== The given and the gap
The current version of the Maritime Cloud Portal (v0.1.0) only fully implements
a very limited set of the features envisioned for the final product and provides 
sketches of a few more. In its current version, the client allows users to:

* creation of organizations
* provision of spatially defined services
** management of endpoints
* location based search of services
* organization and service alias support
* management of user membership
* activity log

This set of features barely scratches the surface of what could be wished for 
and future versions are likely to contain:

* creation and management of Service Specifications and a module for collaboration 
* creation and management of Operational Service categories
* management of identity certificates
* management of user assets and assigning identity to such
* delegation of trust
* ...
